 * player issues.
 *
 * Most of the handling of commands from the client to server (see commands.c
 * for server->client) is handled here.
 *
 * Most of the work for sending messages to the server is done here.  Again,
 * most of these appear self explanatory.  Most send a bunch of commands like
 * apply, examine, fire, run, etc.  This looks like it was done by Mark to
